# Computer Vision Engineering -Image Classification
Computer Vision Engineering: first loop
- Exploratory analysis
- Image Classification on plant datasets using Deep CNN Learning model

Computer Vision Engineering: model
 - Importing a Keras model into TensorFlow.js (Use the Python API to export directly to TF.js Layers format)
 - Load the model into TensorFlow.js (model in a server)
 - Model can be immediately used to make a prediction
